test-05-23-c.txt -> puting the sensor on top of each other, pushing them with my finger down and banging the table.
test-05-25-bubblewrap-bangon.txt  -> doing the same thing but with bubblewrap in between sensors. Notice how there is a rank of nodes in oscillations. 
test-05-25-bubblewrap-free.txt  -> doing the same as above but not holding the sensors down (so no damping effect). Longer oscilations.
