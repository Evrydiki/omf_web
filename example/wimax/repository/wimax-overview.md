title: Overview

This is the dashboards for the GENI WiMAX project.

The scope of work on this project is to leverage a commercial IEEE 802.16e WiMAX base station product to prototype an open, programmable and virtualizable base station node that could work over a metropolitan area and connect with off-the shelf WiMAX handsets and data cards.

This is a portal for monitoring of GENI sites.
