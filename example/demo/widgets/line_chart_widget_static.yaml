# Defines a widget which shows a line chart of a 
# generator measurement from a data source 'voltage'
# containing timestamped 't'
# 'amplitude' measurements for multiple
# 'devices'. Draws a line for each individual device 
# device ('group_by'). Time is in Unix seconds and
# is shown in 'min:sec' format on the X axis (axis/x/ticks/format)
#
